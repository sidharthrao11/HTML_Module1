    <p>&lt;Entity&gt;</p>
    <p>
        An HTML entity is a piece of text("string") that begans with an ampersand(&)
        and ends with an semicolon(;). HTML entities are frequantly used to 
        display reserved charcter  (which would otherwise be interputted as HTML code),  
        and invisible charcters (like non-breaking spaces).you can also
        use HTML charcter entities in place of other charcters that are difficult to type with a stndard keyboard.
